# pong
For this project, I first created an iteration of pong with gravity, using fourth order Runge-Kutta. 
Next, I created a second game, the aim of which is to restore the Sun's nuclear fusion fuel by crashing different asteroids into it. Like the pong game, this was heavily reliant on calculating the gravitational fields of different objects, and then selectively applying it to other objects (for efficiency and for gameplay reasons). To play either of them, simply run:

python pong.py
For the pong game, and:

python funloop.py
For the second game.
